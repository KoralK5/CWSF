The neural network accurately distinguishes between a malignant tumor and a benign one in the provided images. The cancerous cells in the right image exhibit irregular shapes and sizes, along with an indistinct boundary between them, indicating a highly invasive nature. This is in stark contrast to the left image, where the cells appear more orderly and well-defined.
